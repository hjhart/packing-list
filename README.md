# The Open Source Packing List

It's in 
[Github Task List flavored](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)
markdown and 
[MIT Licensed](http://kvz.io/licenses/LICENSE-MIT), 
so pretty easy to fork & personalise for your next trip.

It list has evolved over the years and is **suited for city trips, conferences and <=10 day holidays**.

I'm open sourcing this so you too can enjoy efficient packing and
the peace of mind that comes with that : )

## Tips

- Keep a spare of all toiletry items so you can just keep that bag in your suitcase.
- Nothing beats [printing](https://raw.github.com/kvz/packing-list/master/README.md) 
and checking these with a pen ; )
- Calculations are rounded up : )
- If you miss anything, fork it.  
- If you think others will miss it too, send a pull request!

For added packing-speed, there's a section per bag
